Part 1 â€” Digital Circuits.

The course is divided into 4 2-week sections:
 * Basics of Information, the Digital Abstraction [Assignment 1]
discusses how to encode information using electrical signals
 * CMOS, Combinational Logic [Assignment 2]
design of logic gates, which are circuits of transistor switches that can perform simple operations on the encoded information
 * Sequential Logic, Finite-state Machines [Assignment 3]
build memory components that store information and show how to use them to design circuits that perform sequences of computations
 * Performance Measures, Design Tradeoffs [Assignment 4]
discusses how to minimize the size and maximize the performance of our designs

Each section consists of:
 - 2 lecture chapters, divided into 3 sections:
	 - Lecture Videos (lecture videos and exercises)
	 - Worked Examples (video of a sample tutorial problem being solved, and the sample problem itself)
	 - Tutorial Problems (practice problems with detailed solutions)
 - an assignment
